        <p1><b id="bold">Critics Consensus</b><br><br>He’s taken some lumps over the years, but when it comes right down to it, Keanu Reeves is one of our most<br> dependable action stars. Time will tell if John Wick will join <i>Speed</i> and <i>The Matrix</i> in the action movie pantheon, <br>but critics say this is a stylish, briskly-paced thriller with terrific fight scenes and some sly humor. <br>Reeves stars as a retired hitman reeling from the death of his wife when mob-affiliated hoods break into his house<br> and kill his dog. Soon, our hero is back in the game and practically every gangster in town is in fear for his life.<br> The pundits say the Certified Fresh John Wick is the kind of muscular, full-throttle action flick that’s made with<br> such skill and energy you’ll barely notice how thin the plot is. <br><br><br>

<h1>Filming</h1>
<p>The film was shot digitally with Arri Alexa XT in a distributed aspect ratio of 2.39:1. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela himself chose to work with Arri Alexa XT cameras due to discussions regarding the look of the film John Wick, thus he pushed for a mix of ARRICAM and ALEXA which allowed, in turn, the blend of film and digital. "Everybody loved the idea but when you run the numbers of having two packages and also the cost of film, it gets too expensive, so we decided to work entirely with the ALEXA. It's the camera I've used on commercials so I knew I was comfortable with the ALEXA and I knew I liked it." Sela spoke of the idea that Stahelski, Leitch and himself wished to achieve a visual contrast between John Wick's normal life and the other of which he's drawn back into the underworld of assassins. "We wanted the first look to be soft and clean, and the second to be grittier, darker and sharper</p>

    <h1>Influences</h1>
    <p>Director Chad Stahelski said influences on John Wick included The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), Point Blank (1967), Le Cercle Rouge (1970), and The Killer (1989).
Stahelski said about The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, "Look at Clint Eastwood in – there is so much back-story unsaid there. We're big fans of leaving it to your imagination. We just give you some gold coins, and then it's, "Where do the gold coins come from?" We'll get to that. Have your imagination do some work there." He also said Point Blank (1967) influenced John Wick: "One of the biggest inspirations for the film was Point Blank. We watched it on a loop in our office and there are a couple homages to that [in John Wick]." Park Chan-wook's The Vengeance Trilogy (2002–2005) and Lee Jeong-beom's The Man from Nowhere (2010) influenced the film due to "minimalist composition and graphic nature." For screenwriter Derek Kolstad, both Alistair MacLean and Stephen King were huge influences in the creation of the story of John Wick in terms of characterisation and world-building, stating, with himself stating, "MacLean could build a world, and King could surprise you by what the main character truly was capable of."</p>

<h1>Visual effects</h1>
<p>TJake Braver was the overall Visual Effects Supervisor and visual effects company Spin VFX worked on most of the visual effects on John Wick.The musical score to John Wick was composed by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard, with on-screen violin music performed by Scott Tixier. The film also features a few pieces of additional music such as Marilyn Manson's "Killing Strangers" and T-Bo and Bengie B's "Get Money". The original soundtrack album, John Wick: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, was released digitally on October 21 and received a physical format release on October 27 by Varese Sarabande Records. In addition to Bates and Richard's score, the album features music by artists such as Ciscandra Nostalghia, The Candy Shop Boys, and M86 & Susie Q. Le Castle Vania also provided additional music for the score.</p>
